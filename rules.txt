# Global Rules

1) Installation failures
- If any tool installation errors, retry with a fix.
- If it errors again, diagnose the cause and apply a different fix, then retry.
- Do not skip the tool unless it is genuinely impossible in this environment.

2) Execution failures
- If any tool run errors, retry with a fix (flags, inputs, PATH, permissions, rate/timeout, etc.).
- If it errors again, diagnose the cause and apply a different fix, then retry.
- Do not skip the tool unless it is genuinely impossible in this environment.

3) 9-minute command limit
- Do not run any single foreground command that is likely to exceed ~9 minutes.
- If a step will take longer, adapt the approach:
	- Run in batches/chunks (split inputs; run sequentially and merge outputs).
	- Use resume/checkpoint features if the tool supports it.
	- Reduce rate/concurrency and combine with batching to avoid timeouts.
- Goal: use the tool to its full capability within environment limits (avoid silent false negatives from timeouts).
